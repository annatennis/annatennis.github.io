<h><b>Main Information</b></h>

<p>Formula One is the highest class of international racing. The premise is simple. 10 teams and 20 drivers race around 23 tracks across the world. Points are awarded to the top 10 with first place receiving 25 points and those behind collecting incrementally lower amounts. Race weekends traditionally begin with practice on Fridays, qualifying on Saturdays and topped off with the main event, a Grand Prix, on Sundays.</p>

<h><b>How to Win</b></h>
<p>During an F1 Grand Prix, both drivers and teams earn points which go towards their score in the championship. Whichever team and driver has the highest total by the end of the year is named champion.</p>
<p>The F1 World Championship consists of two distinct competitions. There is one championship for Formula 1 drivers, and another for Formula 1 teams, or constructors. Drivers who finish in the top 10 in any given race score points for both themselves and their teams. At the end of the season, the individual and team with the most points are named champions. In the event of a tie, the teams and drivers with the most wins in the season are ranked higher. Formula 1 drivers score points by finishing in the top 10. If a driver opts to change teams during a season, they retain their individual driver points, and their previous team also keeps the points scored while they were driving for them. An example of the above is Max Verstappen, who started the 2016 season with Toro Rosso before switching to Red Bull after four races. The points he scored in the first races remained with Toro Rosso, but Verstappen himself carried over his driver points to his new seat. Each F1 team runs two cars and both are able to score points. A team can achieve a maximum of 44 World Championship points per race. A new rule introduced in 2019 grants the driver with the fastest lap during a race an extra bonus point, providing that they also finish within the top 10.</p>

<h><b>Driver Numbers </b></h>

<p>In 2014, the FIA introduced a rule in which drivers were allowed to choose their own number between 2 and 99 to race with for the whole of their Formula 1 career, with the number 1 reserved solely for the reigning World Champion.</p>

<h><b>Tire Information</b></h>

<p> Pirelli’s range of 18-inch tyres for 2023 comprises six slick compounds (from hardest to softest: the C0, C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5), along with intermediates and full wets to account for inclement weather conditions. This is an increase of one compound over 2022. Last year’s C1 has become the C0, and is now the hardest tyre in the range, while the 2023-spec C1 is an all-new product that slots between the previous C1 and C2. From the C0-C5 slick range, Pirelli pick three compounds to be used at each Grand Prix, taking into account track characteristics and climates – the hardest trio chosen for venues where the tyres are generally subjected to greater demands, and vice versa. The highest-numbered slick tyre is marked red for the weekend and known as the soft, the middle choice is marked yellow and known as the medium, while the lowest-numbered is marked white and known as the hard, sitting alongside the green intermediate and blue full wet. </p>

<p>
In theory, the soft compound will offer the most amount of grip for a short period of time, making them ideal for qualifying runs, while the medium and hard compounds are likely to be more favourable options over a race distance. Pirelli’s tyres are colour-coded to make it easy for fans to spot what each driver is using at any given time. On a standard weekend, drivers are given 13 sets of dry weather tyres, four sets of intermediates and three sets of full wets. An extra set of softs is reserved for those who reach Q3, while all drivers must use at least two different slick compounds in the race, providing the track is dry. This means tyre compounds will be mandated for each stage of F1’s usual three-part qualifying session: hard tyres only in Q1; mediums tyres only in Q2; and soft tyres only in Q3. Intermediates and wets will be allowed if the RQF sessions are declared wet. At RQF (revised qualifying format) events, each driver may use no more than 11 sets of dry-weather tyres (a slight reduction on the standard number referenced above), four sets of intermediate tyres and three sets of wet-weather tyres.

<h><b>Fun Facts!</b></h>
<p>The fastest ever speed in a race is 231.5 miles per hour.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The sleek design of the car helps to cut through the air faster.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The tyres of a Formula 1 car can also get extremely hot during a race. In fact, they can reach temperatures of up to 100 degrees celsius.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Formula 1 cars are built with a sleek design for a specific reason – to cut through the air more efficiently.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>When Formula 1 drivers zoom around the track, they go through a wild experience called g-force. The “g” in g-force stands for gravity.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>While all Formula tracks have a racing distance of about 305 to 309 km, the Circuit De Monaco remains an exception. The racing distance for Circuit De Monaco is about 260 km – the shortest among all the F1 tracks.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Formula 1 sport is viewed by almost 500 million people annually. Naturally, the drivers who participate in it do not earn a small amount. They earn huge salaries alongside endorsement deals.</p>

<p>Contrary to the popular assumption, F1 does not bar the participation of females. The first woman to have participated in this race was Maria Teresa de Felippis. She raced in 1958. After her, a few other women have taken up the driver’s seat. The best performance was given by Lella Lombardi in 1976. After her, in 1992, Giovanna Amaiti participated in a few races. Finally, in 2015, Susie Wolff participated in the grand prix.</p>
